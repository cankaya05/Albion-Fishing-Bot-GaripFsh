Hello everyone! Meet GARIPFSH – the ultimate fully automatic fishing bot for farming silver effortlessly in Albion Online!

Whether you're at work, school, out and about, or just not using your PC — simply launch GARIPFSH and let it fish for you!

✔️ Automatically fishes anywhere by using pre-defined Station Points across the entire map
✔️ Automatically detects Fishing Nodes and casts the line with perfect accuracy
✔️ If it gets stuck while walking or encounters any error, it fully resets itself and enters recovery mode until everything is back to normal
✔️ No manual intervention needed — automatically refreshes your bait and food buffs. If they run out, it continues fishing without using them
✔️ Detects nearby players and runs from hostile ones
✔️ If attacked by mobs while the bot is running, it uses skills to defend and eliminate them
✔️ Avoids picking up unnecessary items like logs or stones — if it catches anything other than fish, it cancels instantly
✔️ If it attempts to catch too many trash items like wood, it automatically moves to the next closest point

🚨 In case of a critical issue, the bot will notify you via Telegram or Discord with an in-game screenshot explaining the situation.

🛡️ Equipped with high-level anti-cheat protection. It is completely undetectable by BattlEye (0 bans reported so far)
🙊 Don’t worry about being reported! If a player tries to interact with you, the bot will randomly reply with casual phrases.
🏃‍♂️ If a player stays near you for too long, the bot will relocate to a different spot automatically.

No report can get you banned — guaranteed! ✅
